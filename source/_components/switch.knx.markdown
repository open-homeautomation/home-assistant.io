The `knx` switch component is used as in interface to switching actuators.

To use your KNX switch in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: knx
    name: KNX Switch
    address: 0/0/1
    state_address: 0/0/3
```

- **name** (*Optional*): A name for this devices used within Home assistant
- **address** (*Required*): The KNX group address that is used to turn on/off this actuator channel
- **state_address** (*Optional*): Some KNX devices can change their state internally without any messages on the KXN bus, e.g. if you configure a timer on a channel. The optional `state_address` can be used to inform Home Assistant about these state changes. If a KNX message is seen on the bus addressed to the given state address, this wil overwrite the state of the switch object.
For switching actuators that are only controlled by a single group address and can't change their state internally, you don't have to configrue the state address.
